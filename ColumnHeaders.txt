Primary Key:
GlobalEventID

Columns that will be used frequently:
GLOBALEVNTID, SQLDATE, Year, Actor1Name, IsRootEvent, EventCode, NumMentions, Actor1Code, Actor1Name,
Actor2Code, Actor2Name AvgTone, ActionGeo_FullName, ActionGeo_ADM1Code, DATEADDED, SOURCEURL, QuadClass,
ActionGeo_CountryCode, 


Getting rid of:
MonthYear

Columns that will be used less frequently:
FractionDate, Actor1CountryCode, Actor1KnownGroupCode, Actor1Religion1Code, Actor1Type1Code, Actor2Type2Code,
Actor1Type3Code, EventBaseCode, EventRootCode, ActionGeo_Lat, ActionGeo_Long, ActionGeo_Type,  
Actor1Geo_Type, Actor1Geo_FullName, 

Columns that neeed to be transformed:
SQLDATE (to dateTime)
Year (int) 
QuadClass (int)
NumMentions (int)
AvgTone (numeric... ok what is that?)




Either Actor1Code or Actor2Code will always be EDU or %EDU%

Any obvious transformations that need to take place?
1. I would (maybe) like a column that just has the words following the last "/" in the SOURCEURL as a separate column.
2. certian columns [ActionGeo_FullName, Actor1Geo_FullName,] have quotations that need to be removed.
^^ OH WAIT! NVM I forgot that the Dataframe<Row> /csv reader of spark automatically does that now! yay :D
3. I would like to transform ActionGeo_FullName with a UDF to (a) check to see if there are three comma delimited values
(b) if there are only save the first comma delimited value 
^^ This will be if I want to do an analysis by a particular city 

TO_DATE(CAST(UNIX_TIMESTAMP(SQLDATE, 'yyyyMMdd') as DATE))

Subsets (querying by state):
GLOBALEVENTID, FractionDate, Actor1Code, Actor1Name, AvgTone, EventCode, 
ActionGeo_ADM1Code, NumMentions, SOURCEURL
