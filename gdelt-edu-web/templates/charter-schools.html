    <p> This graph displays the occurence of selected keywords within US media article titles
      from April 1, 2013 to present. Although the GDELT dataset extends to 2005, the SOURCEURL field
      was not included until April 1, 2013, and this field was used to find the keywords within
      the titles of the articles.
      The key-phrase 'Charter Schools' appeared more than any other phrase/keyword with 57985 occurences.
      I was intrigued and surprised that it was mentioned so much more than any other topic, so I decided
      to look at the number of mentions and average tone to further delineate its representation
      within the media.

    <div class="topic-intro caption">
    <p> With average tone of the articles on the left Y axis and number of mentions on the right Y axis,
      this graph displays several interesting patterns. Firstly, there are two inverse peaks and troughs
      between the number of mentions and average tone of the articles. The first of these inverse
      peaks occurs in early 2014, and the other in early 2015. Another interesting pattern is that
      since 2015 both the number of mentions of charter schools and the average tone steadily decline
      up until the present.
    </p>
    <p> All three of these patterns suggest a slightly negative portrayal of charter schools in
      the US media considering that when the average tone peaked (i.e. positive articles involving charcter schools),
       the number of mentions of the articles reached a trough and when the average tone dipped
       the number of mentions reached its highest peak since 2014. However, I wanted to further
       investigate what is being said about Charter Schools, so I decided to look at the most
       mentioned articles from these three periods.
