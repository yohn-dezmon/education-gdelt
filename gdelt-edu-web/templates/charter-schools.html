    <p> This graph displays the occurence of selected keywords within US media article titles
      from April 1, 2013 to present. Although the GDELT dataset extends to 2005, the SOURCEURL field
      was not included until April 1, 2013, and this field was used to find the keywords within
      the titles of the articles.
      The key-phrase 'Charter Schools' appeared more than any other phrase/keyword with 57,985 occurences.
      I was surprised that it was mentioned so much more than any other topic, so I decided
      to look at the number of mentions and average tone to further understand its representation
      within the media.

    <div class="topic-intro caption">
    <p> This graph displays the running averages, starting in 2014, of the average tone and number of mentions
      of articles mentioning charter schools in their titles. With the average tone of the articles on the left Y axis
      and the number of mentions on the right Y axis,
      this graph displays several interesting patterns. Firstly, as the running averags are calibrating,
      there are two inverse peaks and troughs
      between the number of mentions and average tone of the articles. The first of these inverse
      peaks occurs in early 2014, and the other in early 2015. Another interesting pattern is that
      since 2015 both the number of mentions of charter schools and the average tone steadily decline
      up until the present.
    </p>
    <p> All three of these patterns suggest a slightly negative portrayal of charter schools in
      the US media considering that when the average tone peaked (i.e. positive articles involving charcter schools),
       the number of mentions of the articles reached a trough and when the average tone dipped
       the number of mentions reached its highest peak since 2014. However, I wanted to further
       investigate what is being said about Charter Schools, so I decided to look at the most
       mentioned articles from these three periods.

    <p> The URLs in the above table are all from 2014 and are sorted by number of mentions
       in descending order. From the initial peak in number of mentions and dip in average tone in 2014,
      we see a mixture of topics emerging that involve charter schools. While some articles
      mention the suspension or deceleration of charter schools within certain communities,
      other articles note the successes the charter schools have achieved, and their potential
      positive outlook. <a href="http://waliberals.org/why-bob-ferguson-randy-dorn-are-wrong-to-support-charter-schools/2015/09/26/">One article</a> that strongly disagrees with charter schools in the state
      of Washington argues that schools should not be run like businesses, and that the charter school
      system is easily exploited by the richest people within a state.

    <p> The URLs in the above table are all from the 2015 peak in average tone, and are sorted
      in descending order by their average tones. While these
      articles show the positive representation of charter schools within US media, since they
      correlate with a dip in the number of mentions they can be interpreted as being less important
      to US media readers. <a href="http://www.abqjournal.com/576014/news/charter-schools-in-nm-thriving.html">One article</a> explains what the authors see as the advantages of charter schools, namely that
      smaller class sizes provide education that is more individualized than public schools, and that
      charter schools are held not only to the standards that public schools are held to,
      but also the goals set by their <b>authorizers</b>. Authorizers can be state agencies, school districts,
      or universities, and they have the ability to shut down charter schools that do not meet the
      terms of their contracts. This sentiment that charter schools
      have the ability to provide better education is mirrored in the positive articles from 2014 as well.
